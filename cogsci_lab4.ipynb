    "The in-house data labeling approach enables the highest quality in data annotation. This type of labeling emphasizes the correct marking of data and often requires consultations with experts in the field. Typically, scientists or individuals affiliated with an organization perform data labeling in this way. However, as the focus is on achieving higher label quality, the time required for the process increases significantly, making the overall process very slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crowdsourcing approach involves labeled datasets that mostly consist of trivial data (e.g., images of animals, transportation, etc.) that do not require additional expertise. Thanks to a large number of registered freelancers on various platforms who, for example, receive tasks to label something during registration, this approach is highly prevalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outsourcing approach essentially represents a middle ground between the two aforementioned approaches. In this case, the annotation task is carried out by an individual or organization specifically trained for it. The advantage of this approach is that the individual or organization receiving the task is already familiar with the subject of the data to be labeled, and it provides accessibility to projects with limited financial resources."
